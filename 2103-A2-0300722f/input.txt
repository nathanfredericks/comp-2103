Students will be given at least one week to complete their assignments. All assignments will be due at 23:59 on the due date and must be submitted to Acorn as per the assignment submission instructions. Assignments submitted by any other method other than Acorn will not be marked. Students are automatically allowed to submit their assignments up to three days late. The first day late will receive a penalty of 10%, and each of the subsequent late days will receive a penalty of 20% per day. Assignments more than three days late will not be marked. Note that assignments often build on one another, so a late submission means that you will have less time to complete the next assignment.
